# Word-Cloud

### This Word Cloud Project is made using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

### Please run the following commands using your Terminal before executing the code....These are all the required modules.


pip install wordcloud <br>
pip install fileupload <br>
pip install ipywidgets <br>
jupyter nbextension install --py --user fileupload <br>
jupyter nbextension enable --py fileupload <br>


### If you  need the `.txt` file then please read the following.


For the input text of your script, you will need to provide a file that contains text only.  For the text itself, you can copy and paste the contents of a website you like.  Or you can use a site like [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) to find books that are available online.  You could see what word clouds you can get from famous books, like a Shakespeare play or a novel by Jane Austen. Save this as a .txt file somewhere on your computer.
<br><br>
Now you will need to upload your input file here so that your script will be able to process it.  To do the upload, you will need an uploader widget.  Run the following cell to perform all the installs and imports for your word cloud script and uploader widget.  It may take a minute for all of this to run and there will be a lot of output messages. But, be patient. Once you get the following final line of output, the code is done executing. Then you can continue on with the rest of the instructions for this notebook.

### NOTE :- This project will only run in JUPYTER NOTEBOOK.
